# new-year-with-turtle-on-pythons
This project uses Python’s turtle graphics module to create a festive Christmas tree. The program draws a tree by layering triangles of different sizes to form the classic tree shape. Decorations, such as colored circles or stars, can be added to make the tree more visually appealing.
